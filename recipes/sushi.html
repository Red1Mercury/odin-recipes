      wasabi!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
      <li>1 cup uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>4 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
      <li>½ cucumber, sliced into thin strips</li>
      <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the water and rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover,
        reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender
        and water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and stir in the
        vinegar and a pinch of salt. Set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap to keep the rice from
        sticking. Place a sheet of seaweed over the plastic. Use your hands to
        spread the rice evenly onto the sheet, leaving about 1/2 inch of seaweed
        empty at the bottom. Arrange strips of cucumber and avocado across the
        center of the rice. Lift the mat and roll over the vegetables once and
        press down. Unroll, then roll again towards the exposed end of the
        seaweed sheet to make a long roll. You may moisten with a little water
        to help seal. Set aside and continue with remaining nori sheets, rice
        and fillings.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Use a sharp wet knife to slice the rolls into 5 or 6 slices. Serve cut
        side up with your favorite sushi condiments.
      </li>
    </ol>
